# 01. Foundations of Data Structures, Databases & Big Data

## 📌 Overview

**Data Structures**, **Databases**, and **Big Data**. This guide helps beginners understand how data is organized, stored, and utilized efficiently across memory, persistent storage, and distributed systems.

## 📘 Data Structures

A **Data Structure** is a way to organize and store data in **main memory (RAM)** so it can be used efficiently during a program's execution. It's a building block for developing efficient software systems and algorithms.

### 🧩 Examples of Data Structures:

- **Linear**:
  - Arrays (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]`)
  - Linked Lists (singly/doubly linked nodes)
- **Non-linear**:
  - Trees (e.g., Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree)
  - Graphs (e.g., for route planning)
- **Abstract**:
  - Stack (LIFO)
  - Queue (FIFO)
  - Hash Tables (used in dictionaries, maps)

### 🔍 Why Data Structures Matter:

- Optimize performance (speed & memory)
- Solve complex computational problems
- Power search engines, compilers, network routers, etc.

### 🧪 Example:

> A GPS system uses **graphs** to find the shortest path between two points using Dijkstra’s algorithm.

## 💾 Databases

A **Database** is a structured system to store, retrieve, and manage data on a **permanent** basis. Databases persist beyond program execution and are widely used in real-world applications.

### 🏗️ Types of Databases:

- **Relational (RDBMS)**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
- **NoSQL**:
  - Document (MongoDB)
  - Key-Value (Redis)
  - Columnar (Cassandra)
  - Graph (Neo4j)

### 📚 Core Concepts:

- **Tables**: Organized rows and columns
- **Queries**: SQL for accessing/modifying data
- **Transactions**: Ensures ACID properties

### 🧪 Example:

> An e-commerce app uses a **relational database** to manage users, products, and orders.

## 📊 Data Warehouses

A **Data Warehouse** is a centralized repository used for **data analysis and reporting**. It aggregates structured data from different sources to support business intelligence.

### 🏢 Key Features:

- Read-optimized for reporting
- Supports OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
- Stores historical data

### 🧪 Example:

> A retail company uses a data warehouse to analyze 5-year sales trends for decision-making.

## 🌐 Big Data

**Big Data** refers to data that is too large, fast, or diverse to be handled by traditional systems.

### 📏 The 5Vs of Big Data:

- **Volume** – Massive scale (terabytes, petabytes)
- **Velocity** – Real-time data generation
- **Variety** – Structured, semi-structured, unstructured
- **Veracity** – Data quality/integrity
- **Value** – Useful insights

### ⚙️ Common Technologies:

- Hadoop (batch processing)
- Spark (real-time processing)
- Kafka (streaming)
- NoSQL databases (flexible schema)

### 🧪 Example:

> Netflix uses **Big Data** to recommend content based on real-time user behavior across the globe.
