# 03 - Data Type and Abstract Data Type (ADT)

## 🧩 What is a Data Type?

A **data type** tells the computer what kind of data a variable can hold, how much memory to allocate, and what operations can be done with that data.

### 🔹 Common Data Types:
- `int` – Integer numbers
- `float` – Decimal numbers
- `char` – Single characters
- `bool` – Boolean (true/false)

Data types are the **basic building blocks** of any programming language.

## 🧱 What is an Abstract Data Type (ADT)?

An **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is a way of thinking about data and the operations you can perform on it, **without worrying about how it's implemented** in code.

It defines the **logic of how data is used**, such as inserting, deleting, or searching, but **not the details of how it's done** (like using arrays or linked lists underneath).

### 🔹 Examples of ADTs:
- **Stack** – Add/remove from the top (LIFO)
- **Queue** – Add at back, remove from front (FIFO)
- **Linked List** – Sequence of connected nodes
- **Tree** – Hierarchical data structure
- **Graph** – Network of connected elements

## 🔁 Difference Between Data Type and ADT

| Feature         | Data Type                | Abstract Data Type (ADT)         |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Meaning         | Type of individual data  | Logical structure of data usage  |
| Focus           | Storage and value        | Operations on data               |
| Level           | Low-level                | High-level                       |
| Examples        | `int`, `float`, `char`   | `Stack`, `Queue`, `Tree`         |

## 🧠 Simple Analogy:

- **Data Type** = Material (like wood, metal)
- **ADT** = Furniture design (like a chair or table)

You use the **material** (data types) to build things according to the **design** (ADT).
